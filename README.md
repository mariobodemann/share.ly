# share.ly
An android app, shortening uris from the share action.

# Note for building

If you want to build it you have to provide you own
bit.ly access key in the file

**app/src/main/res/values/keys.xml**

containing something like
 
**\<string name="bitly_access_key">â€¦\</string>**

. At a later point in time, there will be a login
functionality but not right now, I just wanted to
keep it simple.
